About me - Raman Goyal, Ph.D.Raman Goyal, Ph.D.PublicationsTalksCVRaman GoyalResearch ScientistFollowSan Francisco Bay AreaSRI InternationalEmailGoogle ScholarResearchGateGithubLinkedInAbout meI am currently working as an Advanced Computer Scientist at the renowned Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), part ofSRI International. At PARC-SRI, I am involved in several government and commercially funded interdisciplinary data science projects in the area of Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Motion Planning, Controls & Optimization. I graduated with a Ph.D. from the Department of Aerospace Engineering atTexas A&M Universityin 2020 with a focus on optimal control of soft robotics using data-driven reinforcement learning approaches. I completed my Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IIT Roorkee) in 2013.Research Interest:Motion Planning and Feedback Control for Autonomous SystemsReinforcement Learning Algorithms for High-DOF Robotic SystemsOptimal Sensing/Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification for Dynamical SystemsMachine Learning-enhanced Digital Twin Models for Dynamical SystemsAI-driven Digital Twin Infrastructure for System Health Diagnosis and PrognosisEnhancing Privacy and Security Against Adversarial Attacks in Autonomous SystemsMachine Learning-assisted Innovation in Novel Sensor SystemsSystem-level Design and Optimization of Autonomous SystemsSitemapFollow:GitHubFeed© 2024 Raman Goyal.
