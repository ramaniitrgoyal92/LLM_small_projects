At PARC-SRI, I am involved in several government and commercially funded interdisciplinary data science projects in the area of Reinforcement Learning, Machine Learning, Motion Planning, Controls & Optimization. I graduated with a Ph.D. from the Department of Aerospace Engineering atTexas A&M Universityin 2020 with a focus on optimal control of soft robotics using data-driven reinforcement learning approaches. I completed my Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IIT Roorkee) in 2013.Research Interest:Motion Planning and Feedback Control for Autonomous SystemsReinforcement Learning Algorithms for High-DOF Robotic SystemsOptimal Sensing/Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification for Dynamical SystemsMachine Learning-enhanced Digital Twin Models for Dynamical SystemsAI-driven Digital Twin Infrastructure for System Health Diagnosis and PrognosisEnhancing Privacy and Security Against Adversarial Attacks in Autonomous SystemsMachine Learning-assisted Innovation in Novel Sensor SystemsSystem-level Design and Optimization of Autonomous SystemsSitemapFollow:GitHubFeed© 2024 Raman Goyal.
